Data-Driven Tests 

This repository was created to migrate eggPlant scripts from the Support portal. 

Contents
--------

**/Example 1: Counting The Money** -This set of scripts works together to open the Google Finance page in a web browser, search for a variety of companies using their ticker symbols, and then use OCR to read the stock value for that company and store it in a variable in the script.

**/Example 2: Where the Weather Is** -This set of scripts reads zip codes from a data file, and enters them into Weather.com.

Information contained on Weather.com is then validated using OCR and comparing the results to expected results in the data file.
